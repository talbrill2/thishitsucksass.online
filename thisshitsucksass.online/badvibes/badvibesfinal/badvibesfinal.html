		You may be a weirdo, but you are getting better at css and html. Just remember you can’t do EVERYTHING by yourself… pay attention in class, listen to your teacher, and maybe you wouldn’t be in druck at 4 am the night before going to town on this website. You dont always have to exhibit such BAD VIBEZ. This shit doesnt have to suck ass.online. Don’t be such a stubborn bitch next time, okay?
